## Text Prediction using N-Gram models

  The main goal of this project was to build a predictive text model from a text corpus. This was a "didactic" project, it was the assignment I had to complete for the Capstone Project of the [Coursera Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1). By the way, I got the max score from my student fellows in the peer review (:

The project consisted on several parts:
  1. Getting and cleaning the data
  2. Exploratory analysis
  3. Building n-gram model
  4. Building predictive model
  5. Testing and evaluating the model
  6. Building the UI (shiny app)

The [shiny app](https://bik-tor.shinyapps.io/text-prediction/) was the final product of the project, which provides an interface to access the prediction algorithm that I've built.
