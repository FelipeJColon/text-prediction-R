### What is this?

  This shiny app is the last of the tasks required to complete the Capstone Project of the Coursera Data Science Specialization. The main goal of the project was to build a predictive text model from a text corpus. This app is the final product of the project, which provides an interface to access the prediction algorithm that I've built. 

  The app is very straightforward, it reads a sequence of words from a text input and makes a prediction of the next word. The predicted word, i.e., the word, which the model asssigns the highest probability to, is shown in a button above the text input. When the user clicks the button, the word is appended to the text input. Besides the predicted word, the app plots also a wordcloud containing all words returned by the algorithm. In this cloud, the size of the words is proportional to the probability assigned by the model to each word.
